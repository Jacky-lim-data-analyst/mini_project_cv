> **Warning** ðŸš¨
> It should be noted that the execution of `cv.imshow()` in Google Colab will cause exception. The workaround is as follow:

 ```{python}
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow

## Project title: Document scanner and OCR

### Overview
- **Objective**: perform optical character recognition (OCR) on detected document in different images.
- **Recommended method**: Low-level image processing algorithms: edge detection, perspective transform and OCR engine like Tesseract.
- **Resources**: OpenCV and tesseract. To install tesseract, please refer to this [OverStack forum post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46140485/tesseract-installation-in-windows)

#### Installation of Pytesseract on Windows:
To accomplish OCR with Python on Windows, you will need Python and OpenCV which you already have, as well as Tesseract and the Pytesseract Python package.

**To install Tesseract OCR for Windows**:

1. Download the [installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
2. Run the installer.

**To install and use Pytesseract on Windows**:
1. Simply run `pip install pytesseract`
2. You will need to add the following line in your code in order to be able to call pytesseract on your machine: `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'` depending on path where you installed your Tesseract OCR.

### Dataset
The dataset can be found at: `images/w8/docs`

### Deliverable example
Be able to print out the text present in an image on console.

### Deliverable example
Given an input image, the model will provide a dichotomous variable: ("not-a-santa", "santa").

## Project: Apple detector
### Overview
- **Objective**: Develop and train HOG + Linear SVM pipeline that can detect apples in images.
- **Recommended method**: HOG and Linear SVM
- **Resources**: OpenCV, sklearn, NumPy.
