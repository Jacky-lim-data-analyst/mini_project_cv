    "# Color space / color model\n",
    "In the most common color space, RGB (Red Green Blue), colors are represented in terms of their red, green, and blue components. In more technical terms, RGB describes a color as a tuple of 3 components. Each component can take a value between 0 and 255, where the tuple (0, 0, 0) represents black and (255, 255, 255) represents white. RGB is considered an \"additive\" color space, and colors can be imagined as being produced from shining quantities of red, blue and green light onto a black background.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many color spaces because different color spaces are useful for different purposes. We will typically work with 3 kinds of color models: blue-green-red (BGR), grayscale and hue-saturation-value (HSV).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, color is a continuous phenomenon, meaning that there are an infinite number of colors. Color spaces, however represent color through discrete structures (a fixed number of whole number integer values), which is acceptable since the human eye and perception are also limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "## RGB color space\n",
    "It is an additive colorspace where colors are obtained by a linear combination of Red, Green and Blue values. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some inherent problems asociated with RGB colorspace:\n",
    "- significant perceptual non-uniformity.\n",
    "- mixing of chrominance and luminance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LAB color space\n",
    "3 components:\n",
    "- L: lightness (intensity).\n",
    "- A: color component ranging from green to red.\n",
    "- B: color component ranging from blue to yellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L component is independent of color information and encodes brightness only. \n",
    "\n",
    "## YCrCb color space\n",
    "Like LAB colorspace, the luminance and chrominances are separated into different channels. Y is used to represent luminance (or luma), Cb represents blue-difference, and Cr represents red-difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HSV color space\n",
    "1. Hue is the color attribute that describes pure color. \n",
    "2. Saturation is the quantity that reflect the degree to which pure color is diluted by white light.\n",
    "3. Value or intensity is brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hsv cylindrical spectrum](img_embed/hsv_cylindrical.jfif \"HSV\")\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important** 🗝️\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In OpenCV, hue range is $[0,179]$, saturation range is $[0,255]$, and value range is $[0,255]$. Different software use different scales. So if you are comparing OpenCV values with them, you need to **normalize these ranges**. \n",
    "> The important takeaway is: *Lighting condition can mean the difference between success and failure of your computer vision algorithm.* Thus, color space which could factor out luminance into different channel should be the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversion of color spaces\n",
    "The conversion of color spaces in OpenCV can be done with ease using the `cv.cvtColor(img, ColorConversionCode)`. There are more than 300 types of color conversion modes in OpenCV. You can check them out on the [official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html). This [link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/d25/imgproc_color_conversions.html) is useful if you wish to know more about the mathematical details of color space conversion in OpenCV."
